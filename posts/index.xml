Due to the need for high precision and efficient parts, FTC Team LegoGoa Axiom requested AM hub to 3D print the claw which will be used to grab and lift cones as part of the required task for First Tech Challenge.
At the lab the staff present there explained the process of 3D printing to the students and also provided knowledge regarding the difference between the fusion type 3D printers and additive type 3D printers, the process of plastic mold injection and the different types of materials with which 3d printers work.</description></item><item><title>Fundraising initiative</title><link>http://anaykamat.com/hugo_sample_lg_ak/posts/fund2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://anaykamat.com/hugo_sample_lg_ak/posts/fund2/</guid><description>We (Aniket Bhatikar and Samihan Pangam) conducted a workshop on 21 and 22 December 2022, &amp;lsquo;Basic Electronics and Robotics&amp;rsquo;, as a part of a fundraising initiative.

We conducted this workshop, especially for Mushtifund High School students. Our fee was Rs.500 per student. A total of 6 students had registered.

We had a twist with the cake cutting as shounak used a slider with a knife to cut the robot themed cake.
^We also had a serious monkey storming session as evident from the picture.
We were thinking of building a website which includes everyone&amp;rsquo;s collaboration. Our team coach Saieesh Sir introduced us to GitHub and planned training sessions.</description></item><item><title>Github sessions</title><link>http://anaykamat.com/hugo_sample_lg_ak/posts/github_session/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://anaykamat.com/hugo_sample_lg_ak/posts/github_session/</guid><description>We were thinking of building a website which includes everyone&amp;rsquo;s collaboration. Our team coach Saieesh Sir introduced us to GitHub and planned training sessions.
Yesterday was our first training session on GitHub. In GitHub, everyone in a team can collaborate. It includes all the records of how the team had constructed a website i.e.how many have contributed. It also shows when and what changes a teammate has created on the website.</description></item><item><title>Fundraising initiatives</title><link>http://anaykamat.com/hugo_sample_lg_ak/posts/fund_raising/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://anaykamat.com/hugo_sample_lg_ak/posts/fund_raising/</guid><description>In the true spirit of FIRST, three team members of Legogoa Axi0m 22855 decided to combine outreach and raising funds into one event and they did it successfully by conducting a nominally paid robotics workshop called â€œExplore the World of Robotics.
The team members, Venkatesh Dempo, Shounak Hede and Dhruv Desai (aka Team VSD) conducted their first workshop on 4th December, 2022 at Goa&amp;rsquo;s capital city of Panaji and their second workshop on 8th December, 2022 at Margao.</description></item><item><title>First meeting session</title><link>http://anaykamat.com/hugo_sample_lg_ak/posts/first_meeting_session/</link><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://anaykamat.com/hugo_sample_lg_ak/posts/first_meeting_session/</guid><description>On Sunday, the 4th of December Team Legogoa Axiom gathered at the house of our mentor, Saieesh Gandhi to discuss and understand the format, scoring system and components of the game.
With excellent presentations made by Viraj, Aniket, Sai Pranav and Vighnesh, helped us to understand rules of the game and triggered our thinking about our strategy in the tournament.
We are also very excited that the parts will be arriving in a few days time and we can build and program our robot soon.</description></item></channel></rss>
