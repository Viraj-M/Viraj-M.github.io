The team also got to see the working of the 3d printers first hand.</p><p>The Team got to see the advantages of 3D printing with regards to reducing the number of molds needed to make a part, decrease in fabrication time for the parts and the possibility</p><p>of producing parts on a huge scale while being able to make tweaks in the design to optimize production.</p><p>Team LegoGoa Axiom was also able to introduce the concept of FIRST and make the staff at the lab aware about First Tech Challenge. The staff were very impressed, particularly when</p><p>they learnt the importance of outreach in advancing the competition.</p><p>Honorable minister for IT for the State of Goa, Shri</p><p>Rohan Khaunte who presented the team with the part that has been custom printed in the hub. The lab has graciously provided us the claw free of cost courtesy Govt of Goa.</p><p>Through this visit the team got to learn many concepts about the world of 3D printing and We hope to engage in many more partnerships with AM Hub</p><p>Mr Deelip explained the process of printing and also the business model on how the facilities of 3D printing at AM hub allows one not only prototype but actually undertake small scale production due to the availability of industry scale Figure 4 Standalone 3D printer <a href=https://www.3dsystems.com/3d-printers/figure-4>https://www.3dsystems.com/3d-printers/figure-4</a> at the hub.</p><p>Hon’ble Minister of IT, Govt of Goa then spoke to the team members. The team members explained to him about the competition missions and how we had designed the claw on 3d software and how AM hub is providing us the 3D printed part. He spoke to the individual team members enquiring about ages and schools and handed over the freshly printed parts. He was appreciative about the fact the kids were designing parts for their robots.</p><p>We were very much motivated by the fact that the Hon’ble minister spend so much time speaking to us despite his busy schedule. We are thankful for the Govt of Goa for being proactive in supporting our club especially to Hon&rsquo;ble Minister Shri Rohan Khaunte and Shri Deelip Menezes of 3D systems.</p><p><a href=https://deelip.com/additive-manufacturing-hub-supports-lego-goa>https://deelip.com/additive-manufacturing-hub-supports-lego-goa</a></p><div class=author><img width=30% class=author-image src=/images/logo.png s>
